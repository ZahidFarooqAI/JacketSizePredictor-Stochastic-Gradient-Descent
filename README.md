# JacketSizePredictor-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
Predicting jacket sizes (in inches) based on a personâ€™s age, height (cm), and weight (kg) using a ML algorithm called Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The purpose is to create a simple, yet effective, predictive model suitable for applications in fashion technology, e-commerce, and custom tailoring, where precise sizing can enhance customer needs
